Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

## Goal
Simply to predict the sales price for each house.


# Aknowledgement
The [Ames Housing dataset](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
